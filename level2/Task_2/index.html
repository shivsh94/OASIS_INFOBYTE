            <p>Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company.
                <br>
                As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product design, engineering and global <br>
                manufacturing of the company's electric vehicles, battery products and solar energy products.

                <span class="d">Elon Musk inspires me. Why?</span> Well, it's because Elon Musk is a man with a vision
                and the determination to see that vision through. He has been my role model since I was young and his
                go-getter attitude and will to succeed is one that all should have. His ability to be passionate and
                persistent in spite of multiple failures sets him apart from most people who would give up after one or
                two attempts at something new. Elon Musk created his own rules, did not follow the standard set by
                others and as such he's not a human who will fail easily because he puts all his energy into achieving
                his goals in life which makes him inspiring people all over the world through his actions and words
